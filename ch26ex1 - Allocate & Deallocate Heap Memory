// How to allocate an array of 50 pointers:

int * temps[50];        /* 50 integer pointers */

// The first pointer is called temps[0], second pointer is called temps[1], etc.


// Allocating and deallocating Heap memory Example:

for (ctr = 0; ctr < 50; ctr++)
{
    puts("How many readings for the city?")
    scanf(" %d", &num);


// Allocate that many heap values
    temps[ctr] = (int *)malloc(num * sizeof(int));


// This next section of code would ask for
// each temperature reading for the city. Need to deallocate Heap memory when done.

}


for (ctr = 0; ctr < 50; ctr++)
{
    free(temps[ctr]);
}
