// As with any type of variable, you must define a pointer variable before you can use it.

// & = Address-of operator

// * = Dereferencing operator



// To define an integer pointer variable and a floating-point variable, you simply insert a *:

int * pNum;   /* Defines two pointer variables. "p" stands for pointer.  */

float * pValue;   



// Pointer variables hold addresses of other variables. 




int age = 19;     // Stores 19 to age

int * pAge = &age;    // Links up the pointer


// Another example: 


int age;    // Defines a regular integer

int * pAge;   // Defines a pointer to an integer

age = 19;  // Stores 19 in 'age'

pAge = &age;   // Links up the pointer
