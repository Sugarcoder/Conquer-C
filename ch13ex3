// To find out how much memory integers and floating points are using, use "sizeof()"


// i = sizeof(int);  =  Puts the size of integers into i

// f = sizeof(float);  = Puts the size of floats into f


// Example:

char name[] = "Ruth Claire";

int i = 7;

printf("The size of i is %d. \n", sizeof(i));

printf("The size of name is %d. \n", sizeof(name));



// The length and size of a string are two different values.
