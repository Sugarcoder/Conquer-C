/* The puts() and gets() functions provide an easy way to print and get strings.

puts() = sends a string to the screen. 'puts()' automatically puts a new line at the end of every string it prints.

gets() = gets a string from the keyboard */


// Better to use gets() than scanf(), because scanf() cannot accept strings with spaces.



/* This program asks a user for their hometown and the two-letter abbreviation of their home state.
Then, it uses the string concatenation to build a new string with both town and state, and prints it using puts().  */



// stdio.h is needed for puts() and gets()
// string.h is needed for strcat()
