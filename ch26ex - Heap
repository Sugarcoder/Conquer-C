/* Heap = Unused memory in your computer.

Many times, you'll want to access the heap, because
your program will need more memory than you
initially defined in variables and arrays.

The only way to access data stored in heap memory
is through pointer variables.

Allocated Heap = The heap memory used by your program

Free Heap = Unallocated heap memory     */
