/* Heap = Unused memory in your computer.

Many times, you'll want to access the heap, because
your program will need more memory than you
initially defined in variables and arrays.

The only way to access data stored in heap memory
is through pointer variables.

Allocated Heap = The heap memory used by your program

Free Heap = Unallocated heap memory     */



Two Heap functions: malloc() and free().  malloc() = memory allocate

MUST INCLUDE <stlib.h> whenever you use malloc() and free()    */



int * temp;   // Will point to the first heap value


temps = (int *) malloc(10 * sizeof(int));     // If you just want 10 bytes, you could enter malloc(10);
