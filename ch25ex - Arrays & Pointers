// Array is a special kind of pointer.

// Array names are known as pointer constants.

// You can print the first value in the array like this:

printf("The first value is %d.\n", vals[0]);


// This is the second and third array values are:

printf("The second value is %d.\n", vals[1]);
printf("The third value is %d.\n", vals[2]);




// "pName" is a pointer variable, used like this:

char name[] = "Mary Jane";    // Name points to M
char * pName = "Mary Jane";   // Name points to M




// This is the safe way to store characters in a string (by using a pointer):

char input [81];   // Holds a string as long as 80 characters

char * iptr = input;   // Also could have done char * ipts = &input[0];




// use "fgets()" if you want to limite the number of characters accepted from the user.

// Example:

fgets(iptr, 81, stdin);          // Gets up to 80 characters and add null zero (iptr is a pointer).


// You can use "fgets()" to read strings from data files.




// You can assign the pointer string literals. 
// Example:

iptr = "Mary Jane Matthews";
