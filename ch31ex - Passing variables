/* You don't want all functions to have access to all variables,
because not every function needs access to every variable (if full access is needed, use global variables).

To share data from function to function, you must pass variables from function to function. 


When you pass a variable from one function to another, 
you are passing an argument from the first function to the next.   */


// 'Variable', 'argument' and 'parameter' are sometimes used interchangeably.   


// There are 2 ways to pass arguments from one function to another: by value and by address.  



// Example - Passing a variable to a function (by value) from main() to half():


#include<stdio.h>

main()
{
    int i;

    printf("Please enter an integer...");
    scanf(" %", &i);

    // Now, call the half() function, passing the value of i


    half(i);

    // Shows that the function did not alter i's value

    printf("In main(), 'i' is still %d.\n", i);

    return(0);

}



/*******************************************************/



half(int i)     // Receives the value of i
{
    i = i / 2;

    printf("Your value halved is %d.\n", i);
    return;    // Returns to main()
}
