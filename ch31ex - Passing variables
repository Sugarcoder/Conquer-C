/* You don't want all functions to have access to all variables,
because not every function needs access to every variable (if full access is needed, use global variables).

To share data from function to function, you must pass variables from function to function. 


When you pass a variable from one function to another, 
you are passing an argument from the first function to the next.   */


// 'Variable', 'argument' and 'parameter' are sometimes used interchangeably.   


// There are 2 ways to pass arguments from one function to another: by value and by address.
